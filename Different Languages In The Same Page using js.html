                <h2>Node.js</h2>
                <p>Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications using JavaScript.
                    It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating modern and efficient web applications. React follows a component-based 
                    architecture, where the UI is broken down into reusable components that manage their own state and can be composed together to build 
                    complex user interfaces.

                    Here are some key aspects and concepts of React:
                    
                    Components: In React, UI components are the building blocks of the application. A component represents a reusable piece of the user interface, 
                    which can be a small element like a button or a more complex entity like a form or a complete page. React encourages the composition of components, 
                    where larger components are constructed by combining smaller ones.
                    
                    Virtual DOM: React utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is an abstraction of the actual HTML DOM. The virtual DOM allows React to 
                    efficiently update and render the UI by calculating the minimum number of changes needed. When there is a change in the component's state, 
                    React creates a new virtual DOM tree, compares it with the previous one, and then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.
                    
                    JSX: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) as a syntax extension. It allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, 
                    which represents the structure and layout of the UI components. JSX is not a requirement for using React, but it greatly simplifies the creation and 
                    composition of components

                   It is designed to be platform-independent, which means that Java programs can run on any operating system or platform that 
                   has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</p>

                   It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the late 1970s and has since become one of the most popular languages for system 
                   programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications.</p>
